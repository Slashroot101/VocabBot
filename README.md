# VocabBot
This is my first real project! Be warned, it is very, very messy. Before I knew to use more than one file.
This project not only features MongoDB/Node.js, but it also uses a form of machine learning. Essentially the task I was trying to automate with this project was the use of https://vocabulary.com. 
I was successfully in automating it, and making a computer intelligent. It not only learns from each question, but I was also working on it being 
self correcting. If it recorded the wrong answer, it would know to throw it away. Check out the API, if you are interested. It also has a queue system for scheduling jobs for the job to do. It works great.
